We covered 

You find more extensive lists of **all** possible embellishments at:

-   [Overview for revealjs presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)
-   [Advanced revealjs](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html)

Using these resources, craft your presentation into a slide deck you can use for Day 1 of your course this fall!

We encourage you to **start simple**! Try incorporating a theme and possibly some callouts and / or tabsets. After you've made some simple changes, maybe try out some more embellishments that fit your style!
