title: "Activity 3 -- Make a simple Quarto presentation!"
editor: visual
---

We covered how Quarto presentations differ from Quarto documents!

Using these resources, use RStudio to create a new Quarto presentation with a short bio and introduction about yourself!

Walk through the "New Quarto Presentation" wizard and pay close attention to the prompts your given, choices you make, and the file you're given to start.

We encourage you to **start simple**! We will expand on this slide deck in the next activity!
