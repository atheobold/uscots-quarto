We covered the following "common" Quarto embellishments for presentations:

- [Themes](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html#using-themes)
- [Callouts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html)
- [Tabsets](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#tabsets)
- [Code output locations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#output-location)
- [Fragments](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html#fragments)

You find more extensive lists of **all** possible embellishments at:

- [Overview for revealjs presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)
- [Advanced revealjs](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html)


Using these resources, craft your presentation into a slide deck you can use for Day 1 of your course this fall:

-   a theme
-   callouts and / or tabsets
-   fragments

[Afterward, add at least two additional embellishments that fit your style!]{style="font-size: 1.25em; color: #e28743"}
