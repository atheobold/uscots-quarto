We covered the following "common" Quarto embellishments for presentations:

- [Themes](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html#using-themes)
- [Callouts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html)
- [Tabsets](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#tabsets)
- [Code output locations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#output-location)
- [Fragments](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html#fragments)

You find more extensive lists of **all** possible embellishments at:

- [Overview for revealjs presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)
- [Advanced revealjs](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html)


Using these resources, craft your presentation into a slide deck you can use for
Day 1 of your course this fall! 

We encourage you to **start simple**! Try incorporating a theme and possibly 
some callouts and / or tabsets. After you've made some simple changes, maybe 
try out some more embellishments that fit your style!
