The exhaustive list of YAML options that can be used for HTML documents can be found here: <https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html>.

Using this resource add the following to your document:

-   code folding
-   center alignment of all figures
-   an execution option which suppresses messages output from R

[Afterward, add at least one additional YAML option of your choosing!]{style="font-size: 1.25em; color: #e28743"}
