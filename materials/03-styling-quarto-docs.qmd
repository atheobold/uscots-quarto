## Section Headers

Use `#` to define your section headers and sub-headers.

The more `##` you have, the next level of sub-headers it will be assigned to.

::: columns
::: column
``` markdown
# First level

## Second level

## Third level
```

::: fragment
To number your sections

``` yaml
---
format: 
  html/pdf:
    number-sections: true
---
```
:::
:::

::: column
::: r-stack
![](images/03-section-headers.JPG){fig-alt="A preview of how section headers look in a rendered Quarto document."}

::: fragment
![](images/03-section-headers-numbers.JPG){fig-alt="A preview of how numbered section headers look in a rendered Quarto document."}
:::

:::
:::

## Table of Contents {#toc-slide}

If you want to include a table of contents based on your section headers...

::: columns
::: column
``` yaml
---
format: 
  html/pdf:
    toc: true
---
```
:::

::: column
![](images/03-toc.JPG){fig-alt="A preview of how a table of contents looks in a rendered Quarto document."}
:::
:::

. . .

You can customize with

``` yaml
---
toc-depth:
toc-location:
toc-title:
---
```

## Cross references

You might want to link to a section or subsection within the same Quarto document.

<br>

Assign a section ID to the header

``` markdown
# First level {#section-1}
```

. . .

and cross reference link to the section

``` markdown
Visit [First level](#section-1) for instructions.
```

. . .

The document will then show a hyperlink to the [cross-referenced section](#toc-slide).

## Columns

It can be useful to display content in columns.

``` markdown
::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

Content for first column.

:::
::: {.column}

Content for second column.

:::
:::
```

::: columns
::: column
Content for first column.
:::

::: column
Content for second column.
:::
:::

## You might want uneven columns

``` markdown
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=25%}

+ item 1
+ item 2

:::
::: {.column width=75%}

![](link-to-image.png){fig-alt="Alt text for image"}

:::
:::
```

::: columns
::: {.column width="25%"}
-   item 1
-   item 2
:::

::: {.column width="75%"}
![](images/03-uscots-banner.png){{fig-alt="Banner for USCOTS 2023 conference slogan -- communicating with / about data" width="80%"}
:::
:::

## or more than two columns

``` markdown
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=33%}
Column 1
:::

::: {.column width=33%}
Column 2
:::

::: {.column width=33%}
Column 3
:::
:::
```

::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
Column 1
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
Column 2
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
Column 3
:::
:::

## Callouts

Using callouts can draw attention to certain text or indicate supplemental content.

``` markdown
::: callout-note
There are five types of callouts: note, tip, warning, caution, and important.
:::
```

::: callout-note
There are five types of callouts: `note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

## More callouts

::: callout-note
Here is a reminder note.
:::

::: callout-warning
Callouts provide a simple way to attract attention, for example, to this warning.
:::

::: callout-important
Danger, callouts will really improve your writing.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Caption

Tip with caption.
:::

::: callout-caution
Here is something under construction.
:::

## Callout titles

``` markdown
::: callout-tip
## Tip with Title

This is an example of a callout with a title.
:::
```

::: callout-tip
### Tip with Title

This is an example of a callout with a title.
:::

## And collapse them![^1]

[^1]: Collapse is not supported in Quarto presentations!

``` markdown
::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user.
:::
```

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user.
:::

. . .

Many more callout customization can be explored [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html).

## Tabsets

You might want readers to toggle between content.

``` markdown
::: panel-tabset

## Tab 1

Content for the first tab.

## Tab 2

Content for the second tab.

:::
```

::: panel-tabset
### Tab 1

Content for the first tab.

### Tab 2

Content for the second tab.
:::

## Footnotes

Footnotes can be useful for providing additional information without taking away from the existing content

``` markdown
Here is a footnote reference[^1]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.
```

Here is a footnote reference[^2]

[^2]: Here is the footnote.

. . .

Alternatively,

``` markdown
And another^[Here is the other footnote.]
```

And another[^3]

[^3]: Here is the other footnote.

## Citations

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

<br>

``` markdown
Blah Blah [@uscots2023]
```

<br>

One of the reasons I would use the visual editor!

## Margins[^4]

[^4]: Margins are not supported by presentations.

You might have information you want to put in the margins of a document.

``` markdown
::: column-margin
Content for the margin.
:::
```

## You can place output in the margins

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| column: margin

mtcars[1:6, 1:3]
```

## Or your footnotes and citations

``` yaml
---
reference-location: margin
citation-location: margin
---
```

. . .

<br>

And so much more on [article layouts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html).

## Some of my favorite embellishments

``` yaml
---
embed-resources: true
code-tools: true
---
```

::: callout-note
Providing students with notes or tips separate from the regular content.
