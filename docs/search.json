For example, here are common things I produce\n–&gt; a lesson in document form  –&gt; the same content in presentation form  –&gt; the same content on a page in a website,\nand you can see that all that needed to change going between these formats is a few lines in the yaml. Nothing in the content part of my document. No slide breaks to remove, no citation style to change, no headings to re-level. This ease of transition has freed up time to focus my time on content, and that, folks, is the dream!"

    "text": "This is a Quarto document!\nQuarto is a software that allows you to interweave text and R code to create HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word documents\nThere are two ways to view a Quarto document, (1) as the “Source” file, or (2) as the “Visual” file. We will only use the Visual option in this class, as it allows you to interact with Quarto similar to how you interact with Word.\n\n\nSimilar to a Word Doc, there are a variety of ways you can spice up a Quarto document! Let’s explore a few.\nQuestion 1: Using the formatting options, make a numbered list of your top three favorite animals.\nQuestion 2: Using the formatting options, insert an image of your favorite animal.\nQuestion 3: Now, change the “Formatting your Document” section name to the name of your favorite animal. Make sure your header is a level 1 – use the Header 1 formatting option!\n\n\n\nYou can differentiate the R code within a Quarto file from the body of the document, based on the gray boxes that start with an {r}.\nHere is an example of an R code chunk:\nNotice that after the {r} there is a name (packages), that is the name of the code chunk. It is good practice to name your code chunks based on the action they perform. It makes it easier to navigate to them in the navigation pane.\nThis code chunk has three things we want to pay attention to:\n\nThe #| include: false option at the beginning of the code chunk. We use these options to control how the code output looks in our final rendered document.\nThe library(tidyverse) code loads in an R package called the “tidyverse”. This is code you will have in every lab assignment for this class!\nCode comments which are denoted by a ## symbol. Code comments are a way for you (and me) to write what the code is doing, without R thinking what we are writing is code it should execute.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you click the Render button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.\nQuestion 4: Do you see the above code chunk when you knit the document?

With Quarto, you can create documents, books, presentations, websites, or other online resources. The workshop is comprised of three modules. Module 1 will introduce you to Quarto documents, for both student and instructor use. We will demonstrate how we use Quarto documents and RStudio’s Visual Editor to introduce students to reproducible workflows. We will also demonstrate how Quarto documents can be used to create and distribute teaching resources. Modules 2 and 3 will extend the use of Quarto to create teaching resources, outlining how Quarto can be used to create course slides and course websites. We will conclude with tips on how to make your materials publicly available to share with students and other educators."
