    "text": "This is a Quarto document!\nQuarto is a software that allows you to interweave text and R code to create HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word documents\nThere are two ways to view a Quarto document, (1) as the “Source” file, or (2) as the “Visual” file. We will only use the Visual option in this class, as it allows you to interact with Quarto similar to how you interact with Word.\n\n\nSimilar to a Word Doc, there are a variety of ways you can spice up a Quarto document! Let’s explore a few.\nQuestion 1: Using the formatting options, make a numbered list of your top three favorite animals.\nQuestion 2: Using the formatting options, insert an image of your favorite animal.\nQuestion 3: Now, change the “Formatting your Document” section name to the name of your favorite animal. Make sure your header is a level 1 – use the Header 1 formatting option!\n\n\n\nYou can differentiate the R code within a Quarto file from the body of the document, based on the gray boxes that start with an {r}.\nHere is an example of an R code chunk:\nNotice that after the {r} there is a name (packages), that is the name of the code chunk. It is good practice to name your code chunks based on the action they perform. It makes it easier to navigate to them in the navigation pane.\nThis code chunk has three things we want to pay attention to:\n\nThe #| include: false option at the beginning of the code chunk. We use these options to control how the code output looks in our final rendered document.\nThe library(tidyverse) code loads in an R package called the “tidyverse”. This is code you will have in every lab assignment for this class!\nCode comments which are denoted by a ## symbol. Code comments are a way for you (and me) to write what the code is doing, without R thinking what we are writing is code it should execute.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you click the Render button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.\nQuestion 4: Do you see the above code chunk when you knit the document? Why do you think this is the case?\n\n\n\nYou can include code output in your knitted document:\n\nglimpse(mpg)\n\nRows: 234\nColumns: 11\n$ manufacturer <chr> \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"…\n$ model        <chr> \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4 quattro\", \"…\n$ displ        <dbl> 1.8, 1.8, 2.0, 2.0, 2.8, 2.8, 3.1, 1.8, 1.8, 2.0, 2.0, 2.…\n$ year         <int> 1999, 1999, 2008, 2008, 1999, 1999, 2008, 1999, 1999, 200…\n$ cyl          <int> 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, …\n$ trans        <chr> \"auto(l5)\", \"manual(m5)\", \"manual(m6)\", \"auto(av)\", \"auto…\n$ drv          <chr> \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"4\", \"4\", \"4\", \"4\", \"4…\n$ cty          <int> 18, 21, 20, 21, 16, 18, 18, 18, 16, 20, 19, 15, 17, 17, 1…\n$ hwy          <int> 29, 29, 31, 30, 26, 26, 27, 26, 25, 28, 27, 25, 25, 25, 2…\n$ fl           <chr> \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p…\n$ class        <chr> \"compact\", \"compact\", \"compact\", \"compact\", \"compact\", \"c…\n\n\nQuestion 5: What do you think the above code does? What type of output does it give you?\nHint: You have saw this type of output earlier today!\n\n\n\n\nYou can also embed plots in the rendered document.\nHere is an example of a plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6: What do you think the echo: false option does in the above code chunk?\nQuestion 7: What do you think the mapping = aes(y = manufacturer, x = hwy)) code does?\nQuestion 8: What do you think the labs(x = \"Highway Miles Per Gallon\", y = \"Car Manufacturer\") code does?"

Today, we will work with data that are stored in a Comma Separated Values file (a CSV). For this format of data, we will use the read_csv() function to read in our data.\nThe data are located in the data folder of your project. To load in the data, we need to specify the “path” to the data, or where R needs to look for the data. I like to use the here() function from the here package to read in data, because I find the format intuitive. I’ll walk you through what the code below is doing.\n\nbroadway is the name of the object we are storing the dataset into\nThe <- “assigns” the output of the read_csv() function into the broadway object\nread_csv() is a function that reads in our csv data file\nhere() is a function that specifies where the data live\n“data” is the name of the folder the data live in\n“broadway.csv” is the name of the dataset\n\nClick on the broadway dataset in the upper righthand corner to open up a data viewer for you to look over the dataset.\nQuestion 7: Based on your inspection of the data, what are the observations / cases in these data?\nQuestion 8: What are the variables in these data?\nSubmitting Your Lab: Once you are done answering every question in the lab, hit the “Render” button to create an HTML document with your answers. To submit your HTML on Canvas you need to do the following:\n\nCheck the box next to lab1.html\nClick on the “More” icon (with the gear by it)\nSelect “Export…”\nYou will be given an option to change the name of your document. I don’t. So, bypass this and click “Download”.\nUpload your downloaded Lab 1 file to the Lab 1 Canvas assignment"

With Quarto, you can create documents, books, presentations, websites, or other online resources. The workshop is comprised of three modules. Module 1 will introduce you to Quarto documents, for both student and instructor use. We will demonstrate how we use Quarto documents and RStudio’s Visual Editor to introduce students to reproducible workflows. We will also demonstrate how Quarto documents can be used to create and distribute teaching resources. Modules 2 and 3 will extend the use of Quarto to create teaching resources, outlining how Quarto can be used to create course slides and course websites. We will conclude with tips on how to make your materials publicly available to share with students and other educators."
