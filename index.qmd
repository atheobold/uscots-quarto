# Welcome

Welcome to the USCOTS workshop on Quarto! The goal for the workshop is to introduce statistics educators to Quarto. We will highlight how Quarto can be used educationally, both for students and instructors.

## Learning Objectives for Workshop

At the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to:

-   create Quarto documents
    -   add embellishments to Quarto documents
-   create Quarto presentations
    -   add stylistic embellishments to Quarto documents

## Intended Audience and Level
