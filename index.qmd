## Reproducible documents, presentations, and websites with Quarto

by: Hunter Glanz, Emily Robinson & Allison Theobold

# Welcome!

Welcome to the [USCOTS workshop on Quarto](causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots23/w04-reproducible-documents-presentations-and-websites-quarto-room-106)! The goal for the workshop is to introduce statistics educators to Quarto. We will highlight how Quarto can be used educationally, both for students and instructors.

## Workshop Description

Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown for publishing, including dynamic and static documents and multi-lingual programming language support. With Quarto, you can create documents, books, presentations, websites, or other online resources. The workshop is comprised of three modules. Module 1 will introduce you to Quarto documents, for both student and instructor use. We will demonstrate how we use Quarto documents and RStudio's Visual Editor to introduce students to reproducible workflows. We will also demonstrate how Quarto documents can be used to create and distribute teaching resources. Modules 2 and 3 will extend the use of Quarto to create teaching resources, outlining how Quarto can be used to create course slides and course websites. We will conclude with tips on how to make your materials publicly available to share with students and other educators.

## Learning Objectives for Workshop

At the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to:

-   create Quarto documents
    -   add embellishments to Quarto documents
-   create Quarto presentations
    -   add stylistic embellishments to Quarto documents

## Intended Audience and Level

This workshop is intended for individuals familiar with RMarkdown and RStudio who are interested in learning more about Quarto! No knowledge of Quarto is required.

While we will not be coding in R during the workshop, it could be useful for individuals to have some familiarity with programming in R.
