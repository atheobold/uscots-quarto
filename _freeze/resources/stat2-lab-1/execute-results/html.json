The `#| include: false` option at the beginning of the code chunk.\n    We use these options to control how the code output looks in our final rendered document.\n\n2.  The `library(tidyverse)` code loads in an R package called the \"tidyverse\".\n    This is code you will have in **every** lab assignment for this class!\n\n3.  Code comments which are denoted by a `##` symbol.\n    Code comments are a way for you (and me) to write what the code is doing, without R thinking what we are writing is code it should execute.\n\n## Rendering\n\nWhen you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.\n\n**Question 4:** Do you see the above code chunk when you knit the document?\nWhy do you think this is the case?\n\n## Including Code Output\n\nYou can include code output in your knitted document:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(mpg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 234\nColumns: 11\n$ manufacturer <chr> \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"…\n$ model        <chr> \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4 quattro\", \"…\n$ displ        <dbl> 1.8, 1.8, 2.0, 2.0, 2.8, 2.8, 3.1, 1.8, 1.8, 2.0, 2.0, 2.…\n$ year         <int> 1999, 1999, 2008, 2008, 1999, 1999, 2008, 1999, 1999, 200…\n$ cyl          <int> 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, …\n$ trans        <chr> \"auto(l5)\", \"manual(m5)\", \"manual(m6)\", \"auto(av)\", \"auto…\n$ drv          <chr> \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"4\", \"4\", \"4\", \"4\", \"4…\n$ cty          <int> 18, 21, 20, 21, 16, 18, 18, 18, 16, 20, 19, 15, 17, 17, 1…\n$ hwy          <int> 29, 29, 31, 30, 26, 26, 27, 26, 25, 28, 27, 25, 25, 25, 2…\n$ fl           <chr> \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p…\n$ class        <chr> \"compact\", \"compact\", \"compact\", \"compact\", \"compact\", \"c…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Question 5:** What do you think the above code does?\nWhat type of output does it give you?\\\n*Hint: You have saw this type of output earlier today!\\\n*\n\n## Including Plots\n\nYou can also embed plots in the rendered document.\n\nHere is an example of a plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](stat2-lab-1_files/figure-html/mpg-plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Question 6**: What do you think the `echo: false` option does in the above code chunk?\n\n**Question 7:** What do you think the `mapping = aes(y = manufacturer, x = hwy))` code does?\n\n**Question 8:** What do you think the `labs(x = \"Highway Miles Per Gallon\", y = \"Car Manufacturer\")` code does?\n",
